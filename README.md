# Project Overview

## What's for Dinner?: Recipe Finder

## Project Description

I hope to create a website in which users can input the ingredients they already have at home/or are interested in and find recipes. The search results will display the name of the dish, an image, the ingredients list and the calorie count based on their search query.

[Recipe Finder Wireframe](https://whimsical.com/ga-sei-recipe-finder-wireframe-D48Dw7XvQhnPSyLWZpgzte)

#### MVP

- Allow for users to search recipes using keywords and the search button
- Display up to 10 search results with name of recipe, image, calories, and ingredients list
- Allow users to open up recipe instructions in a new tab
- Clear search results when there's another search & render new results

#### PostMVP

- Allow users to hover over the recipe link and preview instructions.
- Recommend other recipes based on their current search result diet label at the bottom of the page
- Add a second API to allow users to search by dietary preferences/allergy preferences using a drop down menu option.
- Add an animated logo next to the search bar
- Allow users to select favorites with a heart/star button
